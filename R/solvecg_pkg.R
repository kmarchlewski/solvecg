#' Conjugate gradient method for solving and inverting
#'
#' @description The package contains two functions. Both of them are based on
#'    the conjugate gradient method used for solving a symmetric system of equations.
#'    solve_cg function solves iteratively a system of the form Ax = b.
#'    invert_cg function calculates a matrix inverse.
